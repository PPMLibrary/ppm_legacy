PPM stands for Parallel Particle Mesh library. PPM is a Fortran 90 software layer between the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Client Applications for simulations of physical systems using Particle-Mesh methods. The PPM library runs on single and multi-processor architectures, and handles 2D and 3D problems.
