This directory contains the Metis library for mesh decomposition. PPM can
make use of it for assigning subdomains to processors. To use this, ppm
needs to be compiled with #define __METIS set in ppm_define.h.

To build metis:
---------------

> vi Makefile.in

     adjust the values of the variables CC, AR and RANLIB

> ./MakeMETIS

If you use the -Wall (or similar) compiler option, youu will see some
warnings during compilation. Ignore them :-)

The complete libmetis.a will be in ppm/lib/ afterwards. The script will
also delete the unpacked Metis source code again after compilation. Edit
the script if you don't like this.

Then, recompile ppm with #define __METIS enabled.
